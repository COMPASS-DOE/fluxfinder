The goal of `whattheflux` is to allow users to straightforwardly parse
data files generated by infrared gas analyzers; match data and metadata;
compute greenhouse gas fluxes; and generate QA/QC plots and diagnostics.
We emphasize clear and well-documented code, good documentation, and
focused functions that can be easily integrated into conventional 
or [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org)-style analytical pipelines.

It is also straightforward to integrate this package's utilities with
the more powerful flux-computation capabilities of the
[gasfluxes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=gasfluxes) package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of whattheflux from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

remotes::install_github("COMPASS-DOE/whattheflux")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(whattheflux)
## basic example code
```
