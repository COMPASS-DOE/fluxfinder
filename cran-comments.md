## Resubmission

* This is a resubmission.

* This package does not have a single reference to put in the description file, it uses methods established by a variety of literature over a decades. I do not feel that there is a single DOI or manuscript to cite in the description file in this case. 

* Did not change dontrun to donttest because in the single place this is employed it is an example that, by design, generates an error. This seems to be an appropriate use of dontrun. 

* maintainer email changed from wilsonsj@si.edu to sjw22120@gmail.com

* Thank you for your help!
